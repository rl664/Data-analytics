# My Structure - Student 01

## What I See in My Data
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]
8 Vs, height of 8 width of 1, single column, red colour

## What I Think This Means
Each item in the single column says 'V' each item has a size of 1x1, red maybe something bad 

## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?]

may mean void, like a file is void idk 


## Questions I Have
What V means
